# Church Re-Imagined :)

The number of church outreach materials will be streamlined, with a common brand experience incorporated into them all. For example, instead of twelve inconsistently designed post cards, one beautiful postcard template will be altered to suit the purpose at hand. 

Templates in both color and black-and-white will be used to address the impracticality of printing color copies versus sending electronically.
