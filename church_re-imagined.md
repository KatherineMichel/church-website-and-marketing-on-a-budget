# Church Re-Imagined :)

## Church Image Rebrand

Like the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church itself, the new church theme will beautifully blend the traditional and the contemporary by incorporating the traditional United Methodist Church black cross and flame with a contemporary sunflower motif.

## Church Scheme

## New Materials

The number of church outreach materials will be streamlined, with a common brand experience incorporated into them all. For example, instead of twelve inconsistently designed post cards, one beautiful postcard template will be altered to suit the purpose at hand. 

Templates in both color and black-and-white will be used to address the impracticality of printing color copies versus sending electronically.
