# Church Re-Imagined

Ideally, the church website and other materials would have a clean, modern, minimalistic look, with a lightweight, responsive layout that adapts well from desktop to mobile, and other devices. The website would have an intuitive content management system that could be used by non-techies and occasional volunteers. And the new marketing strategy would incorporate both traditional and modern methods in order to fit with changing lifestyles, and to reach the most people possible, perhaps even beyond city boundaries.
