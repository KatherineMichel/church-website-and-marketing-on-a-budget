# Church Re-Imagined :)

## New Website

The church website has a clean, modern, minimalistic look, with a lightweight, responsive layout that adapts well from desktop to mobile, and other devices.

Rather than one prominent homepage photo, the homepage features a patchwork quilt of photos that represent a number of people and activities in the church. Clicking on a photo brings up a small bite of info about the photo subject. This format is straight forward, easy to navigate, and highly mobile optimized. 

The number of church outreach materials will be streamlined, with a common brand experience incorporated into them all. For example, instead of twelve inconsistently designed post cards, one beautiful postcard template will be altered to suit the purpose at hand. 

Templates in both color and black-and-white will be used to address the impracticality of printing color copies versus sending electronically.
