# New Website

The church website is very reasonably priced. The design has a clean, modern, minimalistic look, with a lightweight, responsive layout that adapts well from desktop to mobile. The user experience (UI) is intuitive.

Rather than one prominent homepage photo, the homepage features a charming patchwork quilt of photos that represent a variety of people and activities in the church. This design was not just chosen for its variety though. It has been shown by Twitter that [photos dramatically increase engagement](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/what-fuels-a-tweets-engagement).

Clicking on a photo brings up a small bite of info about the photo subject. This format is straight forward, easy to navigate, and highly mobile optimized.
