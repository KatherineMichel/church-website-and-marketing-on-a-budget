# New Website

The church website was very reasonably priced. The design has a clean, modern, minimalistic look, with a lightweight, responsive layout that adapts well from desktop to mobile. The user experience (UI) is intuitive.

Rather than one prominent homepage photo, the homepage features a patchwork quilt of photos that represent a number of people and activities in the church. Clicking on a photo brings up a small bite of info about the photo subject. This format is straight forward, easy to navigate, and highly mobile optimized.
