# Website Options

First priority was given to the national United Methodist Church's own web hosting platform, followed by a web hosting platform (Ezekiel), which has a partnership with the national United Methodist Church.

Three things that made Ezekiel initially attractive:
* 
Price
* 
Vast number of templates
* 
Potential for a full-website look (as opposed to the blog-like appearance of WordPress)

Final Verdict: The Ezekiel content management system was not intuitive enough to suit the needs of the church.
