# Website Options

The web options chosen all provided value for money, with the two associated with the United Methodist Church being given first priority.

Order of priority given to web hosting options:

1. United Methodist web hosting (based on WordPress)
2. Ezekial Web Hosting (discount due to United Methodist partnership)
3. Squarespace (a low cost web host with beautiful templates)

### United Methodist Church Web Hosting

Possible Themes: 
* Classic
* Sunflowers
* Staind Glass Window

### Ezekiel 
Three things made Ezekiel initially attractive:
* Price ([One time set up fee of $18 + $11/month](http://www.umc.e-zekiel.com/comparison))
* [Vast number of templates](http://www.umc.e-zekiel.com/templates/viewDesigns.asp?)
* Potential for a full-website look (as opposed to the blog-like appearance of WordPress)

Final verdict: The Ezekiel content management system was not intuitive enough to suit the specific needs of the church.
