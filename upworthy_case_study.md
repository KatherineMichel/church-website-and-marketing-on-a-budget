## The Competition (Not Who You Might Expect)
 
Even as search interest in the United Methodist Church declined (see [Google Trends](google_trends.md)), in a short period of time during the past few years, a website with something of a mission for social justice called [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com) became "[the fastest-growing media site in history](http://www.fastcompany.com/3012649/how-upworthy-used-emotional-data-to-become-the-fastest-growing-media-site-of-all-time)," achieving growth that far surpassed that of its closest viral competitors: [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com), [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com), and [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com).

Upworthy is not affiliated with any church and as far as I know, does not intend to compete with churches. However, Upworthy became popular in part by bringing directly to the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Upworthy) news feeds of potential church goers, some of the same type of uplifting content that in the past they would have come across in church through church mission.

If, like me, you were a regular user of Facebook in the Fall of 2013, it's very likely that like me you came across Upworthy content regularly. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Upworthy) has been Upworthy's main source of traffic. According to Upworthy, Facebook is the "king" of viral. When Facebook changed its algorithms at the end of 2013 (reportedly in response to Upworthy's content becoming disportionately popular in the Facebook news feed), Upworthy's traffic dramatically fell. 

The success of Upworthy seems to make moot the argument that people are no longer interested in that which is uplifting. The viral competitors that Upworthy far surpassed in growth did not have the same social justice mission as Upworthy. 

### The Secret of Upworthy's Success

So why were a record number of people attracted to Upworthy content? How did Upworthy achieve this unprecedented growth and in such a short time? Feel free to find out from Upworthy's own [About Us Page](http://www.upworthy.com/about) and [PowerPoint presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/Upworthy). In a nutshell, Upworthy's content is technically and emotionally optimized to induce sharing. Here is a summary of the Upworthy approach:

#### 1. Repurposed and Repackaged Content

Upworthy staff members comb through online content (often "[evergreen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(journalism))") to identify stories that have the potential to become viral

A recent example is the story of Anthony Carbajal. 

Anthony, a former [photographer](http://anthonycarbajal.com/about-me) who had been recently diagnosed with ALS and has a family history of ALS (he currently cares for his mother, who has ALS), posted an emotional [Ice-Bucket Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Bucket_Challenge) video telling his story in his own words. 

Anthony Carbajal YouTube post: "[Ice Bucket Challenge- Uncensored and Sexy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h07OT8p8Oik)"

![](upworthy/anthony-carbajal-als-ice-bucket-challenge-youcaring.jpg)

The content was repackaged and given an ambiguously dramatic headline intended to provoke the reader to click (this is sometimes referred to as "[click-bait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait)"); Upworthy's rule of thumb is to write 25 headlines for each story, then user test to determine the most popular one

#### 2. Website Tactics

The Upworthy site is user tested and optimized to the nth degree, to attract attention, invoke a response, and make sharing easy from website and across the most high traffic sites. 

[Upworthy Homepage](http://www.upworthy.com): use of endless scrolling

Upworthy comprehensive header menu
![](upworthy/upworthy-menu.jpg)

Upworthy forms are designed to be impossible not to notice "[above the fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold)," and across the webpage [hotspots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_hotspots) and common reading patterns (F pattern, Z pattern, and Guttenberg diagram).

Upworthy prominent share buttons and newsletter sign up form
![](upworthy/upworthy-header-and-newsletter-sign-up.jpg)

Upworthy modals are triggered by the movements of the cursor. For example, if the cursor is moving toward the page tab to click x and close the page, a modal might pop up to re-engage.

Upworthy modal tactic: daily email
