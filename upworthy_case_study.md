# Upworthy Case Study

### Google Trends

A trick that I've learned from the tech analysts [I follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/katimichel/following) is to use [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends) to gauge the level of interest in a word (or words), including by region. 

### Google Trends for "Pretty Prairie"

Unfortunately, Google Trends does not go into enough detail to give results for "Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church," but here is a fun graph for the results for ["Pretty Prairie"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pretty%20prairie), from around 2004 to September 2004; The town of Pretty Prairie, Kansas happens to host the world famous [Pretty Prairie Rodeo](http://www.pprodeo.com) (the biggest night rodeo in Kansas) every July. The spikes in the Google Trends graph below all happened in July :)

### The Competition (Not Who You Might Expect)

But what wasn't in decline? A website called [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com). 

This is the Google Trends graph for the phrase ["Upworthy" worldwide](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=upworthy), beginning when Upworthy was founded in 2012, until January 2015: <br>

According to Fast Company, Upworthy was "the fastest growing media site of all time." 

It was only when Facebook, Upworthy's main source of traffic, changed its algorithms, that Upworthy's traffic dramatically fell.


a website with something of a mission for social justice, sharing content intended to be uplifting. 

Though Upworthy is not affiliated with a church, and has probably not set out to compete with churches, some of Upworthy's content is the type of content that would be of interest to church-goers.

Enticing headlines, arguably "click-bait" (Upworthy's rule of thumb is to write the headline 25 different ways)
* 
Content invoking an emotional response
* 
Optimization for ease of sharing
* 
User Testing to the nth degree

### The Changing Global Ministry Landscape and What the Church Can Learn from Upworthy

There is a market for "uplifting" content. The church may need to repackage its message and how the message is delivered if it is to compete for the public's attention.
