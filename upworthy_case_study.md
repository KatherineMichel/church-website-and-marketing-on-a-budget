# Upworthy Case Study

### Google Trends

A technique that I've learned from the tech analysts [I follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/katimichel/following) is to use [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends) to gauge the level of interest in a word (or words), including by region. 

### Google Trends for "Pretty Prairie"

Unfortunately, Google Trends does not go into enough detail to give results for "Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church," but here is a fun graph for the results for ["Pretty Prairie" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pretty%20prairie), from around 2004 to September 2004; The town of Pretty Prairie, Kansas happens to host the world famous [Pretty Prairie Rodeo](http://www.pprodeo.com) (the biggest night rodeo in Kansas) every July. The spikes in the Google Trends graph below all happened in July :)

The Google Trends graph for "[Pretty Prairie Rodeo" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%22pretty+prairie+rodeo%22) demonstrates similar spikes in interest.

### Google Trends for "United Methodist Church"

Unfortunately, the Google Trends graphs for the search phrase "United Methodist Church" are not so fun, because they show a steady decline in search interest. 

Here is the Google Trends graph for the phrase ["United Methodist Church" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=united%20methodist%20church), from around 2004 to January 2015:

### The Competition (Not Who You Might Expect)

Even as search interest in the United Methodist Church declined, during the past few years, a website called [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com) became "[the fastest-growing media site in history](http://www.fastcompany.com/3012649/how-upworthy-used-emotional-data-to-become-the-fastest-growing-media-site-of-all-time)." Upworthy is a website with something of a mission for social justice, and became popular in part by sharing the same sort of uplifting content that would appeal to many church-goers. 

Upworthy is not affiliated with any church and as far as I know, does not intend to compete with churches.

This is the Google Trends graph for the phrase ["Upworthy" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=upworthy), beginning when Upworthy was founded in 2012, until January 2015:

In a short period of time, Upworthy achieved growth that far surpassed that of its closest viral competitors: Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and Business Insider.

If you were a regular user of Facebook in the Fall of 2013, it's very likely that you came across Upworthy content. 

It's rumoured that when the content of one organization becomes disproportionately popular on the Facebook news feed, Facebook changes its algorithm. When Facebook, Upworthy's main source of traffic, changed its algorithms at the end of 2013, Upworthy's traffic dramatically fell.



What makes Upworthy very interesting though is that the overall focus of Upworthy's content is very different than that of its traffic competitors. Although Upworthy's competitors may sometimes publish articles about social justice, social justice is Upworthy's overall focus. 




The success of Upworthy seems to make moot any argument that people are not interested in stories that are inspiring,

### The Secret of Upworthy's Success

How did Upworthy achieve unprecedented growth and in such a short time? Feel free to find out from [Upworthy](http://www.slideshare.net/Upworthy) itself. Here are a few of the main points:

<br>
Through ...
* 
Enticing headlines, also called "click-bait" and generally frowned upon by respected media (Upworthy's rule of thumb is to write each headline 25 different ways, then user test to choose the best one)
* 
Content invoking an emotional response
* 
Optimization for ease of sharing
* 
User Testing to the nth degree

### The Changing Global Ministry Landscape and What the Church Can Learn from Upworthy

There is a market for "uplifting" content. The church may need to repackage its message and how the message is delivered if it is to compete for the public's attention.
