# Church Image Rebrand

The church marketing materials have been created by different people as needed over a period of many years, with no thought to creating one church brand spanning all materials.

The church will have two themes:
* 
The traditional United Methodist cross and flame theme
* 
A contemporary sunflower theme

# The Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity).

Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. 

The sunflower symbolizes bright, "happy" faces turned toward the sky amid the warmth and promise of a new day.

The inspiration for the church's new brand is the sunflower.
