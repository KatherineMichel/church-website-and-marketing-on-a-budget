# Church Image Rebrand

The inspiration for the church's new brand is the sunflower.

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity).

Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. 
The sunflower symbolizes bright, "happy" faces turned toward the sky amid the warmth and promise of a new day.

The church has a Microsoft Publisher program that has been extremely underutilized, including a number of templates never before used.
