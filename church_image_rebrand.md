# Church Image Rebrand

Like the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church itself, the new church theme will beautifully blend the traditional and the conventional by incorporating:
* The black version of the traditional [United Methodist cross and flame](http://www.umc.org/resources/cross-and-flame)
* A contemporary sunflower motif

# The Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity).

Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. The sunflower symbolizes warm welcome, bright optimism, and renewal. 

The number of church outreach materials will be streamlined, with a common brand experience incorporated into them all. For example, instead of twelve inconsistently designed post cards, one beautiful postcard template will be created, then altered to suit the purpose at hand. 

Templates in both color and black-and-white will be created to address the impracticality of printing color copies versus sending electronically.
