# Church Image Rebrand

The church marketing materials had been created by different people as needed over a period of many years, with no thought to creating one church brand spanning all materials.

The inspiration for the church's new brand is the sunflower.

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity).

Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. 

The sunflower symbolizes bright, "happy" faces turned toward the sky amid the warmth and promise of a new day.
