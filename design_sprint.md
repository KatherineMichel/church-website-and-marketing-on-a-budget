# Research and Design Sprint

## What is This All About?
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The point of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype without the time and expense of creating a full version.

## Design Sprint

* Business opportunity 
* Lightning demos 
* Lay it out 
* Success metrics — Ex. Kerry Rodden’s HEART framework.
* Existing research 
* Team interviews
* Analytics

Can do User Studies/Microstudies/Team Interviews ahead of time if needed

Sketch the most important user story (as a group) = visual map

* Choose parts of the problem (divide up user story)
* Take notes (5 minutes) "how might we"
* Mind map (10–15 minutes)
* Crazy Eights (5 minutes)
* Storyboard (10–20 minutes)
* Three-minute critiques (3 minutes per idea)

* Whiteboard the final user story (comic book frames)
* Create protoype

### User Testing

* Define favorable and unfavorable user criteria
* Post ad for users, including link to recruiting screener questionnaire

When you have identified prospective users: 

* Call the prospective users by phone
* Send a follow-up email, including important info and a link to non-disclosure agreement to sign; Request prospective user to reply to confirm

Example confirmation email

Example non-disclosure agreement

* Create interview guide

* Conduct user study
* Summarize and analyze findings
