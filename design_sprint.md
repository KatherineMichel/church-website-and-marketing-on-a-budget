#### People Needed

I would do most of the design work alone, and act as facilitator for select brainstorming and planning group work, particularly involving the church's Nurture Outreach Witness (NOW) Committee. 

Members of the NOW (Nurture, Outreach, Witness) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church, would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. 

I provided a list of 'tactics' by cost taken from the United Methodist Marketing Plan Audit Implementation Step.
