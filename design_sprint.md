### People Needed

I would do most of the design work alone, and act as facilitator for select brainstorming and planning group work, particularly involving the church's Nurture Outreach Witness (NOW) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church. 

## Design Sprint Process

### "How might we"

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. In preparation for their group work, I provided the NOW Committee with an example plan, a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started). 

See [New Marketing Strategy](new_marketing_strategy.md) for the finished result. See also [Advanced Marketing Options](advanced_marketing_options.md) for a list of advanced marketing options :).

### Goals and Measurable Objectives Chart

[United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) suggests using a Goals and Measurable Objectives Chart as part of the [Evaluation Step](http://www.umcom.org/learn/evaluation-adjustment-resources) of its [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).
