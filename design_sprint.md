## Design Sprint Process

### "How might we"

Members of the NOW (Nurture, Outreach, Witness) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church, would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. 

I provided a list of "Tactics" by cost taken from the United Methodist [Marketing Plan Audit Implementation Step](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF).
