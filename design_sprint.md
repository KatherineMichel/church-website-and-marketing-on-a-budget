### People Needed

I would do most of the design work alone, and act as facilitator for select brainstorming and planning group work, particularly involving the church's Nurture Outreach Witness (NOW) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church. 

## Design Sprint Process

### "How might we"

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. In preparation for their group work, I provided to the NOW Committee an example plan and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the Implementation Step of a United Methodist Marketing Plan Audit.

Example tactics less than $300
