## Design Sprint Process

### "How might we"

Members of the NOW (Nurture, Outreach, Witness) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. 

See [Advanced Marketing Options](advanced_marketing_options.md) for the guidance and list of "Tactics" by cost taken from the United Methodist [Marketing Plan Audit Implementation Step](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) that I provided to the NOW Committee.
