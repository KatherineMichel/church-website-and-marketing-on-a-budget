## Critique of [umc.org](www.umc.org) 

## Jesus and John Wesley, Social Pioneers

Maybe the United Methodist Church need look no further than [social network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) pioneers Jesus and John Wesley for inspiration. 

Jesus grew a social network that consisted of family, friends, and followers, who spread his message by word of mouth until it became viral the world over. 

[John Wesley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley) spread the Methodist religion across the United States by creating a social network of followers who were organized into "Class Meetings" across geographic territories and ministered to by "Circuit Riders." 

"I look upon all the world as my parish" -John Wesley, founder of Methodism
