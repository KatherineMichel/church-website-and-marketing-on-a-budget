The website has an appealing design. The color scheme is a nod to the United Methodist cross and flame logo and the colors are repeated throughout the website. The layout is appealing, including a "carousel" of photos "above the fold" and a newspaper like homepage below, all designed to attract attention. The main shortcoming of the United Methodist online presence is the convoluted nature of the content.
