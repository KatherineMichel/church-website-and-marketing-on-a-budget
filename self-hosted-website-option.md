# Self-Hosted Website Option

In addition to hosting a site through United Methodist Web Hosting, Squarespace, or Ezekial, a more advanced option exists: self-hosting. I did not cover that option in this GitBook, because it was not right for Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church. However, I cover that option in my GitBook [Creating a Self-Hosted Church Website](https://www.gitbook.com/book/katherinemichel/creating-a-self-hosted-church-website/details).
