### What Does "Making a Website" Mean?

"Making a website" can mean many things. 

"Making a website" can be as simple as using a content management system to "drag and drop" content into pre-determined spaces, without touching the underlying code, but also without much freedom to change the website structure. 

"Making a website" can be as sophisticated as writing all of the underlying code from scratch, to create a highly customized website. But with the freedom to customize comes the risk of "jank."

And the middle ground is 
1. 
Using a hosted content management system, but having the option to customize some of the code, for instance, the code of the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS); Or...
2. Using a template based website system to design and deploy your site, but not from scratch (ex. Jekyll via GitHub)
