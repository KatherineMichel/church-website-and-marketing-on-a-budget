### What Does "Making a Website" Mean?

"Making a website" can mean many things. 

"Making a website" can be as simple as using a content management system to "drag and drop" content into pre-determined spaces, without touching the underlying code, but also without much freedom to customize the website. 

Example: Weebly Drag and Drop Website Builder

Or, "Making a website" can be as sophisticated as assembling all of the underlying code, to create a highly customized website. But with the freedom to customize comes the risk of "jank."

And there is a lot in between, for instance:

1. Using a hosted content management system that offers the option to customize some of the code, for instance, the code of the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS); Or...

WordPress CSS Customization

2. Using a simplified template system to design and deploy your own code (For example, the static portfolio that I made with Bootstrap then deployed via GitHub gh-pages; Jekyll is another popular option)
 

### Front-End Design
* HTML
* CSS (Think 10,000 page website and you want to have one place to alter the design of every page at once; That place is the Cascading Style Sheet). 
* JavaScript

### Back-End Automation
* Python (Multi-purpose Web Development language with excellent Data Science tools; Currently, the most taught Computer Science language)  
* Ruby (Popular and well-supported)
* PHP (Used in WordPress, and at a few famous companies such as Facebook and Wikipedia, but otherwise, not as well suported as Python and Ruby)
* Node.js

### Hybrid
* Jekyll (A simplified template system to design and deploy your own code)
