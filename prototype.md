## Snapchat for Church
Calling a venture [X for Y](http://avc.com/2014/01/this-for-that) is often frowned upon. I decided to do it in this case because Snapchat is synonymous with ephemeral messaging and this is a unique use case. It make for an interesting juxtaposition between the traditional and the modern.

Whole experience, start to finish:
simple, intuitive

Create a prioritized list of tasks user is trying to accomplish ("user stories")

### National Church Re-Imagined
* Put equal emphasis on physical, digital, and partnership
* Maintain a full-stack architecture anytime possible
* Publicize to existing membership to help achieve a network effect
* Optimize for psychology and sharing
* Practice minimalism as mush as possible, but design to reach people who are using different devices (example. more mobile use in the developing world)
* Integrate new methods of ministry. This also creates new publicity angles
