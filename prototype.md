## Snapchat for Church
Calling a venture [X for Y](http://avc.com/2014/01/this-for-that) is often frowned upon. I decided to do it in this case because Snapchat is synonymous with ephemeral messaging and this is a unique use case. It make for an interesting juxtaposition between the traditional and the modern.
