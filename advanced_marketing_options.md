### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO is an important aspect of ensuring that people 'discover' your website. Identify the SEO functionality of your website and verify that it is enabled and optimized. Search engines will 'crawl' the content of your website and give your site a page ranking. 

In some websites, SEO will be optimized manually via the "head" part of the code. In other websites, SEO will be automatic. 

Google is the most popular search engine in most countries, often followed by Yahoo. Identify the most important search phrases associated with your website and test the search results. Make sure that cookies are not enabled. Otherwise, your search results might be skewed due to the search history of the computer. 

And most important of all, encourage people to use the website! The search ranking of the website will rise naturally as a result.

### Google+ and Google Rich Snippets
Verify that the Google map info is correct. If possible, link the website to the map. Consider creating a Google+ organization page, and/or Google rich snippet for support
