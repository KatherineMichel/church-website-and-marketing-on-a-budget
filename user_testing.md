Favorable user criteria

Unfavorable user criteria
* Extremely technical

## Recruiting Screener Ad
Google Ventures often uses a [Craig's List ad](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Sample-Craigslist-ad.png) to recruit users. Because members of the United Methodist Church would be the primary users, I sent an email ad to members of the congration with a link to the recruiting screener. 

## Recruiting Screener

## Recruiting Screener Results
Because I used Google Forms to create the recruiting screener, the results were automatically collected in a spreadsheet in Google Drive. 

## Contacting Prospective Users

### Phone Call
Phone call to prospective user

### Follow Up Email

Though Google Ventures suggests including in the email a link to a non-disclosure agreement ([Google Ventures example non-disclosure agreement](http://www.gv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Google-Ventures-Research-Sprint-Sample-NDA.pdf)), I did not feel that one was needed for this situation. 

In the follow up email, I requested that the prospective users reply to confirm.
