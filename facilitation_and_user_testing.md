# Facilitation and User Testing

## Facilitation 

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee, which plans outreach for the church, collaborateed on a new church marketing plan. I was the facilitator for brainstorming and planning group work. 

We used the United Methodist Communications
* Marketing Audit
* Communications Audit

## Problem Structuring Methods

### Reverse Engineering for Success
We would then seek to answer the following questions:

* What does a successful Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church look like?
* Whom should the church reach?
* How should the church reach them?

### Church Vision and Mission Statements
We started by reflecting on the existing Vision and Mission Statements

In preparation for their group work, I had provided the NOW Committee with an example plan, a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).
