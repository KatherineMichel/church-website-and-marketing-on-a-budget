# Facilitation and User Testing

## Reverse Engineering for Success
We would use problem structuring methods to answer the following questions:

* What does a successful Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church look like?
* Whom should the church reach?
* How should the church reach them?
* How should the church measure progress?

## Facilitation 

Members of Administrative Council Committee and Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee, which both plan outreach for the church, began to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. I facilitated the group using the following United Methodist Communications resources:

Notes from previous church strategy meetings

In preparation for their group work, I provided the Administative Council and NOW Committees with an example marketing plan, and a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).

#### How should the church reach them?

##### Skills Inventory

Members of the church would take stock of the skills of individual members. This skills inventory would be used to identify ways to optimize what the church has to offer the community.

##### "How might we"

Audiences, tactics, and resources

After having identified the target audiences, we would look at a list of possible tactics and compare against available resources. We would also consider which methods would be best suited to which audiences. 

Tactics less than $300<br>

Tactics between $300 and <br>

Tactics over $1000<br>

#### How should the church measure progress?

##### Metrics

[United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) suggests using a Goals and Measurable Objectives Chart as part of the [Evaluation Step](http://www.umcom.org/learn/evaluation-adjustment-resources) of its [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).
