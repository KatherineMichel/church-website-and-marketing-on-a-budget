# Facilitation and User Testing

## Reverse Engineering for Success
We would use problem structuring methods to answer the following questions:

* What does a successful Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church look like?
* Whom should the church reach?
* How should the church reach them?
* How should the church measure progress?

## Facilitation 

Members of Administrative Council Committee and Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee, which both plan outreach for the church, began to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. Using the United Methodist Communications [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started) and [Marketing Audit Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF) (with a few adaptations), I would use group facilitation during the normal NOW Committee and Administrative Council Committee meetings to collect the information needed to create the marketing plan. 

### Step 1: Values and Vision Deliverables

Deliverables:
* Core Values
* Demographics
* Vision Statement
* Key Messaging/Elevator Statement

#### Core Values Brainstorming Results
* Christ-centered, ecumenical
* friendly, welcoming, inclusive
* community-centered, part of local community, diverse community, bringing community together
* open hearts, open minds, open doors

#### Demographics
A story was told by a committee member of having once been a member of a large church and being hesitant to go up to people to welcome them because there were so many people, it was difficult to tell regular church-goers from guests. It was pointed out that knowing exactly who is a regular church-goer and who isn't is one of the advantages of a smaller church, and being able to identify who is in need is one of the advantages of a small town. 

#### Church Vision and Mission Statements
We started by reflecting on the existing Vision and Mission Statements

#### Key Messaging/Elevator Statement

It was decided by the group that the Vision Statement is the Key Message/Elevator Statement. 

### Step 2: Perception and Needs
In process

### Step 3: Strategy
Homework/Marketing Plan Deliverables
* S.W.O.T. (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
* Target Audience
* Strategic Objective
* Goals
* Resources

#### S.W.O.T
The group chose to use N.O.I.S.E (Needs, Opportunties, Improvements, Successes, Exceptions) instead of S.W.O.T.

##### Needs (of the community)
The committee members identified offering services where there is a gap as a major opportunity. Examples:
* a weekly get together for kids (particularly low-income) during summer, when school is out and Community Youth Group does not meet, featuring activities (movies, songs), meals
* classes for parents, such as preparing budget-friendly meals, or finance 101
* home maintenance for the elderly
* estate planning, farm succession planning

##### Opportunities
The committee members felt that the opportunities were the same as the needs. 

##### Improvements
* Getting people to come in and possibly stay (health clinic as example)
* Finding ways to go outside of the church and minister to the community (thinking outside the box)

##### Successes
* friendly people
* lots of leadership in the community
* involved in many community initiatives and events (for instance Food Bank and all-churches VBS)

#### Target Audience

It was determined through facilitation that the committees sought to target young people, particularly low-income and single-parent families with little or no support system, perhaps using tactics that would offer practical support.
