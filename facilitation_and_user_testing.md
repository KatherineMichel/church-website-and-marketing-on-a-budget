# Facilitation and User Testing

## Reverse Engineering for Success
We would use problem structuring methods to answer the following questions:

* What does a successful Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church look like?
* Whom should the church reach?
* How should the church reach them?
* How should the church measure progress?

## Facilitation 

Members of Administrative Council Committee and Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee, which both plan outreach for the church, began to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. Using the United Methodist Communications [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started) and [Marketing Audit Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF) (with a few adaptations), I would use group facilitation during the normal NOW Committee and Administrative Council Committee meetings to collect the information needed to create the marketing plan.
