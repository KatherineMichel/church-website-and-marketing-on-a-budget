When the website initially went live, it was ranked lower than the other Pretty Prairie church websites, which had all been in existence for years and had undoubtedly risen in the rankings due to clicks over time. This is normal and it was expected that the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church website would gradually rise in rankings, which it did. For instance, the amount of website traffic increases dramatically in July at the time of the Pretty Prairie Rode. 

There is a strange twist to the story that demonstrated to me that even with pre-planning, I could not have predicted where the website traffic would come from. 

On September 29, 2016, I received a Facebook message that someone had given Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church a review, with a rating of 1 out of 5 stars. I was very surprised by this. The person seemingly had no connection at all to Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church and lived in a different part of the country. I likened this to spam. 

One September 30, 2016, I received a Facebook message that someone had posted to Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church's Facebook page and the post began, "What is wrong with you people?? You are evicting..." When I went to the Facebook page, the post was non-existent. 

On October 5, 2016, a man called Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church and said he wanted to make a complaint about a story that he had seen on the news the night before about a cemetery.

All three of these people had something in common. They had mistaken Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church in Kansas for Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church in Howe, Indiana. 

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church in Howe, Indiana has a cemetery. The church decided to construct a new church driveway, but there was a grave where they wanted the driveway and so began a dispute between the church and the family of the deceased about what to do. The story was written up in an Indiana paper local to the church: "[Family battles LaGrange Co. church over mother's grave site](http://wsbt.com/news/local/dispute-over-a-grave-site-leaves-one-family-making-an-emotional-decision)". People who saw the story began to Google "pretty prairie united methodist church" in order to make a complaint on its Facebook page. The traffic to the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church in Kansas website went up as people mistook it for the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church in Howe, Indiana website.
