### Example Business Model

| Business Model | Notes |
| -- | -- |
| Donations | Is this self-sustaining? |
| Freemium | Supported through in-app purchases, ads, ect. |
| Limited Freemium | Free for a year then $ .99 |
| Paid | Potential users may be excluded |
| Price based on OS | Different operating systems generate different amounts of revenue |

## Talent
The app would need to be built by people of the right skill level. They could be recruited from:

* Staff
* Third party business
* Volunteers
* Contest entries

### Market Size
Currently, United Methodist membership is steadily falling in the United States, but dramatically rising in certain developing countries. However, the app would be creating a new market. 

### Primary Users and Network Effect

#### Primary Users Segmentation

| Region | Approximate Number of United Methodist Members |
| -- | -- |
| U.S. | 7,725,039 |
| Non-U.S. | 4,000,000 |
| Total Worldwide | 12,000,000 |

| Region | Approximate Number of Congregations |
| -- | -- |
| Worldwide | 34,892 |

#### Network Effect
Building the app is not the only challenge. A network effect also needs to be created. This is where a missed opportunity exists. The United Methodist Church would not be starting from scratch to build up a user base. A potential user base of 12 million United Methodist members already exists, not to mention casual church-goers and newcomers. 

### User Acquisition
Who to target and how?

* World population: ~7 billion
* Number of Christians: 
* Number of people with internet: 
* Number of people with desktop computers:
* Number of people with mobile phones:

### OKRs
