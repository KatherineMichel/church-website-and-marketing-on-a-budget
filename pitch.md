### Market Size
Currently, United Methodist membership is steadily falling in the United States, but dramatically rising in certain developing countries. However, the app would be creating a new market. 

## Competitive Analysis

According to Pew Research, churches are a highly competitive marketplace. 

### Idea Maze
Placeholder
![](pitch/idea-maze.jpg)

Who are competitors? 
* Other traditional Mainline churches
* Contemporary churches such as LifeChurch

### Network Effect
Building the app is not the only challenge. A network effect also needs to be created. This is where a missed opportunity exists. The United Methodist Church would not be starting from scratch to build up a user base. A potential user base of 12 million United Methodist members already exists, not to mention casual church-goers, newcomers, and those unaffilitated with the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church could start by promoting the app to its own member base. 

In the book Zero-to-One, Peter Thiel recommends dominating a small market first, then expanding vertically. 

### Primary Users Segmentation

| Region | Approximate Number of United Methodist Members |
| -- | -- |
| U.S. | 7,725,039 |
| Non-U.S. | 4,000,000 |
| Total Worldwide | 12,000,000 |

| Region | Approximate Number of Congregations |
| -- | -- |
| Worldwide | 34,892 |

### User Acquisition
Who to target and how?

* World population: ~7 billion
* Number of Christians: 
* Number of non-United Methodist Christians: 
* Number of non-Christians
* Number of people with no religions affiliation:
* Number of people with internet: 
* Number of people with desktop computers:
* Number of people with mobile phones:

## Information Capture
Global database

## Talent
The app would need to be built by people of the right skill level. They could be recruited from:
