## Reverse Engineering

If successful, what will this venture look like?

## Competitive Analysis

Churches- highly competitive marketplace

### Idea Maze
* Who are competitors? 
* How does their product compare?
* What behavior/expectations by uses might be transferable? 

## High Level Value Proposition

## Deal Structure

### Corporate Structure Options

* Non-profit
* B Corporation

Cost Structure/Revenue Streams
More than one cash flow source?

### Example Business Model
* Donations (self-sustaining?)
* Freemium (in-app purchases, ads)
* Freemium for certain amount of time (ex. What's App was free for a year, then $.99, available on many devices, helped popularity)
* Paid (may cause some users to be excluded)
* Price varies based on device used (iPhones more expensive/users tend to spend more)

## Talent

* If not, can people of the right skill level be recruited?

Staff, contest, volunteers?

## Users and Motivation

* Who are our most important customers?

* What do people need?
* Why would a user want this product/service?
* What user need will the product satisfy?
* How do users make decisions?
* To what degree is product/service a compelling purchase?

### Product/Service Bundle by User Segment

### Reach, User Engagement, Customer Relationship Management 
* How will user segments be reached?
* How easy is it to retain customers?

### Market Size
Total market for product/service- large, rapidly growing? 

New Market

### Primary Users and Network Effect

#### Primary Users Segmentation

| Region | Approximate Number of United Methodist Members |
| -- | -- |
| U.S. | 7,725,039 |
| Non-U.S. | 4,000,000 |
| Total Worldwide | 12,000,000 |

| Region | Approximate Number of Congregations |
| -- | -- |
| Worldwide | 34,892 |

#### Network Effect
Building the app is not the only challenge. A network effect also needs to be created. This is where a missed opportunity exists. The United Methodist Church would not be starting from scratch to build up a user base. A potential user base of 12 million members already exists, not to mention casual church-goers and newcomers. 

### User Acquisition
Who to target and how (prioritization)

* World population: ~7 billion
* Number of Christians
* Number of people with internet: 
* Number of people with desktop computers:
* Number of people with mobile phones:
