| -- | -- |
| [Non-profit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) | Traditional charity |

### Product/Service Bundle by User Segment

## Cost Structure

### Cost to Produce/Deliver
Potentially, the most costly aspect of producing the app would be technical talent. The app would need to be built (across platforms) by people of the right skill level. They could be recruited from:

| Method | Cost |
| -- | -- |
| In-house staff | Regular wages |
| Third-party business | Contract pay |
| Volunteers | Free |
| Contest/hackathon entries | Prizes |

Entries received from a contest or "Christian hackathon" might not meet the quality standard required, but a contest or "Christian hackathon" could be a fun and less obvious way to generate creative ideas, while providing a challenge for developers. 

### Cost to Reach New Users
* In-church campaign
* Public campaign

Time/resources

A new approach to ministry offers new publicity. Press releases and articles can be provided to news outlets about relevant and unique angles. 

### Customer Support Costs
| Method | Cost |
| -- | -- |
| Volunteers | Free |

## Market

### Market Size
Currently, United Methodist membership is steadily falling in the United States, but dramatically rising in certain developing countries. However, the app would be creating a new market.

In the book Zero-to-One, Peter Thiel recommends dominating a small market first, then expanding vertically. This could mean initially publicizing the app within United Methodist congregations, then expanding to publicizing to the public. This could also mean publicizing the app by country.  

### Network Effect
The two most difficult aspects of getting such an app off the ground would most likely be: 
* Building the app
* Creating a network effect

This is where a missed opportunitiees exists to use the United Methodist Church's existing user base to achieve a permanent network effect that reaches the public. Unlike many other new ventures, the United Methodist Church would not be starting from scratch to build a user base. A potential user base of 12 million United Methodist members already exists, not to mention casual church-goers, newcomers, and those unaffilitated with the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church could start by heavily promoting the app to its own member base. 

### Primary Users Segmentation

Number of United Methodist congregations

| Region | Approximate Number of Congregations |
| -- | -- |
| Worldwide | 34,892 |

Number of United Methodist Church members

| Region | Approximate Number of United Methodist Members |
| -- | -- |
| U.S. | 7,725,039 |
| Non-U.S. | 4,000,000 |
| Total Worldwide | 12,000,000 |

Of these members and constituents:
* Who are the mobile users?
* Who would become a mobile user/use app?

From my own experience, there are members, typically of an older generation, who do not use mobile, and are not receptive to adopting it.  

#### Information Capture
The United Methodist Church could leverage data by creating a global database of church members/regular church-goers, and app-users. 

### Vertical Integration/User Acquisition
Who to target and how?

* World population: ~7 billion
* Number of Christians: 
* Number of non-United Methodist Christians: 
* Number of non-Christians
* Number of people with no religions affiliation:
* Number of people with internet: 
* Number of people with desktop computers:
* Number of people with mobile phones:
 
## Competitive Analysis

According to [Pew Research Religious Landscape Survey](http://religions.pewforum.org/reports), churches are a highly competitive marketplace. 

### Idea Maze
