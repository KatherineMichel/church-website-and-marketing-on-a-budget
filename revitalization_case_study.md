# Revitalization Case Study

The national United Methodist Church provides a website called [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) with many resources for growing membership. 

As my church project evolved, I found myself using a number of United Methodist Commuications resources, including the following: 

* United Methodist [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started)
* United Methodist [Communication Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/communication-audit-syncs-everything-together)
* [Re-Think Church](http://www.umcom.org/rethink-church)
* [Small Membership Church Ministries](http://www.greatplainsumc.org/smallmembershipchurchresources)

Over time, I began to realize that the process Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church has gone through might be of interest to other churches. I decided to contact United Methodist Communications about creating a feature article about Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church's revitalization process. 

I looking up the [United Methodist Communications contact info](http://www.umcom.org/about/contact-us-at-united-methodist-communications) and sent an email.
