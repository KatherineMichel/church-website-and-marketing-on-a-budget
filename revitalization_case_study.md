# Revitalization Case Study

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is affiliated with the global [United Methodist Church](http://www.umc.org), which provides a variety of resources to its membership churches and the public, including the resources found on the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) website. As the church revitalization project unfolded, and I continually returned to United Methodist resources for support, I began to think that the lessons we had learned could be useful to other churches that are faced with the same sort of challenges and opportunities. 

It is not uncommon for an article about an individual church to be featured in a global United Methodist Church website or publication. I contacted United Methodist Communications to inquire if I could submit an article about Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church's revitalization process, to be featured on the United Methodist Communications website. 

The answer I received was very positive.
