### The Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity). 

Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. The sunflower symbolizes warm welcome, bright optimism, and renewal.
