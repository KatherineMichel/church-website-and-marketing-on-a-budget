A technique that I've learned from the tech analysts whom [I follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/katimichel/following) is to use [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends) to gauge the level of interest in a word (or words), including by region. 

Looking at search interest via Google Trends to gauge the effectiveness of traditional and modern religious methods amid changing lifestyles. Insight into tech trends and which channels could be the best to use to reach people locally, or perhaps even worldwide.

Google Trends graph for the phrase ["Upworthy" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=upworthy), from 2004 to 2015. [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com) was founded in 2012. When [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Upworthy), Upworthy's main source of traffic, changed its algorithms at the end of 2013 (reportedly in response to Upworthy's content becoming disportionately popular in the Facebook news feed), Upworthy's traffic dramatically fell.
