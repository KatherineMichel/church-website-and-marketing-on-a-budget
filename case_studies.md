## The Changing Global Ministry Landscape and What the Church Can Learn from The Bible App and Upworthy

The church should not aspire to be like Upworthy or to copy The Bible App. However, there is a market for "uplifting" content. The church may need to repackage its message and how the message is delivered if it is to compete for the public's attention. 

### Jesus and John Wesley, Social Pioneers

Perhaps the United Methodist Church need look no further than [social network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) pioneers Jesus and John Wesley for inspiration. 

Jesus grew a social network that consisted of family, friends, and followers, who spread his message by word of mouth until it became viral the world over. 

[John Wesley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley), founder of Methodism, spread the Methodist religion across the United States by creating a social network of followers who were organized into "Class Meetings" across geographic territories and ministered to by "[Circuit Riders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_rider_(religious))."
