# Problem Statement

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing materials for the church. 

The church's previous website was no longer in existence after the web host stopped hosting. 

The Church wanted to have a new website and marketing materials with a modern, new look.

The cost of the website would need to fit within the church's budget and would need to have a content management system that would be user friendly for extreme non-techies.
