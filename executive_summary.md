# Executive Summary

### Proposition

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing plan for the church. 

### Problem
The church's previous website was no longer in existence after the web host had stopped hosting. The website was made using an outdated technique called Flash. I made the screenshot below locally using files that I recovered from the web host.

### Find-a-Church Page

Without an independent website, the church was making due with a Find-a-Church page, (a basic information page hosted for free by the national United Methodist Church).

I would Project Manage a modern new website and marketing plan for the church.
