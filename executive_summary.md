# Executive Summary

### Note: 
For the tl:dr, check out [Old Design](old_design.md) and [New Design](new_design.md) :) 

### Proposition

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing plan for the church. 

### Problem
The church's previous website, which had been made using an outdated technique called Flash, was no longer in existence because [the web host had stopped hosting](https://kslib.info/1013/Blue-Skyways-Transition). I made the screenshot below locally (see glossary) using files that I recovered from the web host. See [Old Design](old_design.md) for screenshots of all the old website pages.

### Find-a-Church Page

Without an independent website, the church was making due with a Find-a-Church page, (a basic information page hosted for free by the national United Methodist Church).

### Solution

I would Project Manage a modern new website and marketing plan for the church, using low-cost tools and available resources.
