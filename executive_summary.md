# Executive Summary

### Proposition

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing materials for the church. 

### Problem
The church's previous website was no longer in existence after the web host stopped hosting. The church was making due with a basic information page hosted for free by the national United Methodist Church (see below).

The church wanted to have a new website and marketing materials with a modern, new look.

The church marketing materials had been created by different people as needed over a period of many years, with no thought to creating one church brand spanning all materials.

### Constraints
The cost of the website and marketing materials would need to fit within the church's budget. The project would draw upon existing church resources (such as the Microsoft Publisher program installed on the church computer that has been extremely underutilized, including a number of basic templates). Also, the website would need to have a content management system that would be user friendly for extreme non-techies.
