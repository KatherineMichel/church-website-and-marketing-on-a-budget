# Executive Summary

### Proposition

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing materials for the church. 

### Problem
The church's previous website was no longer in existence after the web host had stopped hosting. The website had been made using an outdated technique called flash. I made the screenshot below from files that I recovered from the web host.

Without an independent website, the church was making due with a Find-a-Church page, (a basic information page hosted for free by the national United Methodist Church).
