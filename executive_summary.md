# Executive Summary

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing materials for the church. 

The church's previous website was no longer in existence after the web host stopped hosting. And the church marketing materials had been created by different people as needed over a period of many years, with no thought to creating one church brand spanning all materials.

The Church wanted to have a new website and marketing materials with a modern, new look.

The cost of the website would need to fit within the church's budget and would need to have a content management system that would be user friendly for extreme non-techies.
