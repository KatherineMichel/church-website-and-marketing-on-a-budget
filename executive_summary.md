# Executive Summary

### Proposition

Members of the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church contacted me about designing a new website and marketing plan for the church. 

### Problem
The church's previous website, which had been made using an outdated technique called Flash, was no longer in existence because [the web host had stopped hosting](https://kslib.info/1013/Blue-Skyways-Transition). I made the screenshot below locally (offline, on a personal computer) using files that I recovered from the web host.

### Find-a-Church Page

Without an independent website, the church was making due with a Find-a-Church page, (a basic information page hosted for free by the national United Methodist Church).

I would Project Manage a modern new website and marketing plan for the church.
