## Dilemma
Pretty Prairie is in the middle of Kansas, which is in the Bible Belt. As would be expected of a city in the Bible Belt, there are many people of faith in Pretty Prairie. 

Still, changing lifestyles (digital and philosophical reorganizations) and a dwindling, predominantly elderly church population have had a negative effect on church attendance. 

Pretty Prairie has a very small population. Though there are surrounding cities with far larger populations, there is no need for people to travel to Pretty Prairie to go to church. So in the physical world, church membership in Pretty Prairie is limited by the number of people in the city.  

But there is no such limit in digital world.
