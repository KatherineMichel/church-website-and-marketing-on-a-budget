Notably, New Jerusalem Church is using the very popular WordPress [Twenty Eleven](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyeleven) theme. I also considered this template for Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church because the national United Methodist Church offers this template as part of its hosting platform. But, I decided to forgo it in order to have something unique to Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church.
