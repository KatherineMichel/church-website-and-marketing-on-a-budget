* Intuitive User Experience (UI)

### Content

* Avoid 'data dumps'
* Antiquated design
* Avoid filling space with clipart
* Poor color choice
* Wasted space
* 
### Areas for Improvement
* Poor color choice (blue and pink are not complementary)
* Use of clip art should be avoided if possible
* Welcome Page runs the risk of being a "data dump," wasted space
* Photo Page grid not aesthetically pleasing
* Wasted space in Youth Activities Page
* No social media sharing options
* Archaic design for website header/nav-bar
* Website does not seem representative of all church demographics, groups, activities

Also, the website would need to have a content management system that would be user friendly for extreme non-techies.
