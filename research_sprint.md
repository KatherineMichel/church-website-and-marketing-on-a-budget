### Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church Mission Statement

"To glorify God by sharing the love of God, the teachings of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit within our community"

### "How might we"

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. In preparation for their group work, I provided the NOW Committee with an example plan, a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started). 

See [New Marketing Strategy](new_marketing_strategy.md) for the finished result.
