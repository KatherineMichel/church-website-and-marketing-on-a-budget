#### [Google Trends Graph for Phrases "United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App" "Upworthy"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church%2C%20LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App%2C%20Upworthy&cmpt=q&tz=) from 2004 to 2015

The United Methodist Church, which is clearly of declining interest, is still a "giant" compared to Upworthy at Upworthy's peak search volume. LifeChurch and The Bible App are miniscule in comparison, but on the rise and with a strong, modern network effect in place of the sort that could disrupt traditional church.

## Surviving Disruption

In the article [Surviving Disruption](https://hbr.org/2012/12/surviving-disruption), Max Wessel and Clayton Christensen explain how a company can disrupt itself in order to avoid being disrupted:

* Identify the strengths of your disrupterâ€™s business model
* Identify your own relative advantages
* Evaluate the conditions that would help or hinder the disrupter from co-opting your current advantages in the future.
