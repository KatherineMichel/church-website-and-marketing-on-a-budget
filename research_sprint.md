## Identifying the Problem and Opportunity

Helpful resource: the [Google Ventures Questions to Ask Before Starting User Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/questions-to-ask-before-starting-user-research) 

### The "business" problem

* Dwindling local population 
* Predominantly middle age and older local population
* Four churches in close proximity
* Increasingly digital lifestyles

### The "business" opportunity
 
* Untapped potential via modernization
* More channels than ever to reach people
* Greater accessibility of resources and knowledge
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* Larger potential user base
 
### Leverage

* What questions do you want to answer?
* What features/tasks do you want to test?
