Pretty Prairie population: 

Pretty Prairie tends to be a very quiet place, except for every July when Pretty Prairie hosts the world famous 
[Pretty Prairie Rodeo](http://www.pprodeo.com) (the largest night rodeo in Kansas). The spikes in the Google Trends search interest graph below for phrase ["Pretty Prairie" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pretty%20prairie) all happened in July.

As I learned more about Pretty Prairie and the local and national United Methodist Church, I became increasingly more aware of the problem and opportunity. 

### The "Business" Problem

* Dwindling, predominantly older adult local population 
* Changing lifestyles (digital and philosophical reorganization)
* Four churches in close proximity

### The "Business" Opportunity

* Members receptive to a community outreach campaign and revitalization effort
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* More channels (traditional and digital) than ever to reach people and more people than ever to reach
* New and undiscovered ways to minister
