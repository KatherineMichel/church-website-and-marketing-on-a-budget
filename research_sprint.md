# Research Sprint

## Reverse Engineering for Success
The questions I would seek to answer in my research sprint:
* What does a successful national United Methodist Church look like?
* Whom should the church reach?
* How should the church reach them?

## Declining United Methodist Membership in the U.S.

According to the [2012 United Methodist State of the Church Report](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties/state-of-the-church/documents/2012-state-of-the-church-report.PDF) (the latest report of its kind), between 2000 and 2010, United Methodist membership in the United States declined by 7.8%. <br>

Google Trends graph for the phrase ["United Methodist Church" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church), from around 2004 to 2015.

This declining search interest comes almost 100% from the United States.   

However, the United Methodist Church reported 

Professing membership

| Region | % Change in Membership |
| -- | -- |
| West Africa | 297.6% |
| Congo | 253.9% |
| Africa Central | 170.8% |
| Philippines | 156.5% |
| United States | -7.8% |
| Germany | -16.2% |
| Central and Southern Europe | -25.6% |
| Total Change | +25.6% |

Membership in the United Methodist Church is on the decline in the United States. 



## Declining Interest in Mainline Churches

This problem of declining interest is not exclusive to the United Methodist Church. Mainline churches in general are struggling stay relevant.

Words associated with mobile ("iPhone" "app" "Android") are up and to the right. Non-mobile words ("desktop" "website") are on the decline.

## Longterm Decline
Is this decline in global United Methodist membership inevitable, or can the situation be turned around, for instance, through a different technology approach? The answer might be found by taking a look at the success of LifeChurch. LifeChurch's Google Trends Graph results are up and to the right.

### [Google Trends Graph for Phrases "United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App" "Upworthy"](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church%2C%20LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App%2C%20Upworthy&cmpt=q&tz=) from 2004 to 2015

The United Methodist Church, which is clearly of declining interest, is still a "giant" compared to Upworthy at Upworthy's peak search volume. LifeChurch and The Bible App are miniscule in comparison, but on the rise and with a strong, modern network effect in place of the sort that could disrupt traditional church.

### Surviving Disruption

In the article [Surviving Disruption](https://hbr.org/2012/12/surviving-disruption), Max Wessel and Clayton Christensen explain how a company can disrupt itself in order to avoid being disrupted:

* Identify the strengths of your disrupterâ€™s business model
* Identify your own relative advantages
* Evaluate the conditions that would help or hinder the disrupter from co-opting your current advantages in the future.

## Survival
According to the [2012 United Methodist State of the Church Report](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties/state-of-the-church/documents/2012-state-of-the-church-report.PDF), "Critical research conducted in 2010 found that 15 percent of United Methodist congregations in the United States were considered 'highly vital.' As a result, the Connectional Table and the Council of Bishops embraced a 10-year adaptive challenge to increase vitality across the denomination, especially in places where churches have been on the decline... Because of this Spirit-filled movement, the 2012 State of the Church Report focuses on vital congregations. Annual conferences and congregations in our worldwide connection are finding new ways to share the Good News of Jesus Christ, revitalizing the United Methodist movement in places of need. We praise God and celebrate the growth and vitality of our churches in Africa and the Philippines and will continue to find ways to strengthen our global connection"

## Critique of [umc.org](http://www.umc.org) 
![](national-united-methodist-church/umc.org-home-page.jpg)

The website has an appealing design. The color scheme is a nod to the United Methodist cross and flame logo and the colors are repeated throughout the website. The layout is appealing, including a "carousel" of photos "above the fold" and a newspaper like homepage below, all designed to attract attention. The main shortcoming of the United Methodist online presence is the convoluted nature of the content.

## Jesus and John Wesley, Social Pioneers

Maybe the United Methodist Church need look no further than [social network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) pioneers Jesus and John Wesley for inspiration. 

Jesus grew a social network that consisted of family, friends, and followers, who spread his message by word of mouth until it became viral the world over. 

[John Wesley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley) spread the Methodist religion across the United States by creating a social network of followers who were organized into "Class Meetings" across geographic territories and ministered to by "Circuit Riders." 

"I look upon all the world as my parish" -John Wesley, founder of Methodism
