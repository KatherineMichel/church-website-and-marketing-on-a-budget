Pretty Prairie (population 688) tends to be a very quiet place, except for every July when Pretty Prairie hosts the world famous 
[Pretty Prairie Rodeo](http://www.pprodeo.com) (the largest night rodeo in Kansas). The spikes in the Google Trends search interest graph below for phrase ["Pretty Prairie" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pretty%20prairie) all happened in July.

As I learned more about Pretty Prairie and the local and national United Methodist Church, I became increasingly more aware of the problem and opportunity. 

### The "Business" Problem

* Dwindling, predominantly older adult local population 
* Four churches in close proximity

* Members receptive to a community outreach campaign and revitalization effort

### "How might we"

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. In preparation for their group work, I provided the NOW Committee with an example plan, a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).
