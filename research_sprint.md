Pretty Prairie (population 688) tends to be a very quiet place, except for every July when Pretty Prairie hosts the world famous 
[Pretty Prairie Rodeo](http://www.pprodeo.com) (the largest night rodeo in Kansas). The spikes in the Google Trends search interest graph below for phrase ["Pretty Prairie" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pretty%20prairie) all happened in July.

As I learned more about Pretty Prairie and the local and national United Methodist Church, I became increasingly more aware of the problem and opportunity. 

### The "Business" Problem

* Dwindling, predominantly older adult local population 
* Changing lifestyles (digital and philosophical reorganization)
* Four churches in close proximity

### The "Business" Opportunity

* Members receptive to a community outreach campaign and revitalization effort
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* More channels (traditional and digital) than ever to reach people and more people than ever to reach
* New and undiscovered ways to minister

## Whom Should the Church Reach?

## How Should the Church Reach Them?

### Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church Mission Statement

"To glorify God by sharing the love of God, the teachings of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit within our community"

### "How might we"

Members of the Nurture, Outreach, Witness (NOW) Committee would begin to collaborate on a new church marketing plan. In preparation for their group work, I provided the NOW Committee with an example plan, a [Marketing Plan Worksheet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/UMCOM_YOUR_MARKETING_PLAN_WORKSHEET.PDF), and a ["Tactics" List](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Website_Properties_UGC/market-your-church/documents/STEP_4_IMPLEMENTATION_HOMEWORK.PDF) taken from the [United Methodist Communications](http://www.umcom.org) [Marketing Audit](http://www.umcom.org/learn/market-your-church-getting-started).
