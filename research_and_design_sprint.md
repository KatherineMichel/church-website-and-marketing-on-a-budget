# Research and Design Sprint

## What is This All About?
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The point of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype without the time and expense of creating a full version. 

## People and Supplies

#### Supplies Needed
* Sticky notes 
* Drawing pens 
* Whiteboard
* Whiteboard markers
* Dot stickers (for voting)
* Timer 
* Snacks 
* Sticky stuff

* And a working space

#### People Needed

At least one person

A complex Research and Design Sprint might include: 
* Facilitator
* CEO (buy-in/decision-maker)
* Designer
* Product manager
* User expert 
* Engineer
* Marketer

This would be a simpler Research and Design Sprint. I would do most of the work alone, and act as facilitator for select group work. 

## Let's Identify the "Problem"

### Wanted: Answers

* What questions do you want to answer?
* What features/tasks do you want to test?

Go through the [Google Ventures Questions to Ask Before Starting User Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/questions-to-ask-before-starting-user-research) 

### Opportunity

* Identify the "business" opportunity

### Leverage

* Gather existing research, analytics
* If needed, conduct interviews, microstudies

## Design Sprint

* Print out existing product screens
* Lightening demo "competitor" products, or non-competitive products that offer insight
* Identify success metric (ex. HEART framework)

* Understand the "problem"
* Ponder "how might we"
