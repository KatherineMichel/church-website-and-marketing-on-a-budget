# Research and Design Sprint

## Purpose
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version. 

## People and Supplies

#### Supplies Needed
* Sticky notes 
* Drawing pens 
* Whiteboard
* Whiteboard markers
* Dot stickers (for voting)
* Timer 
* Snacks 
* Sticky stuff

* And a working space

#### People Needed

I would do most of the design work alone, and act as facilitator for select brainstorming and planning group work, particularly involving the church's Nurture Outreach Witness (NOW) Committee. 

## Identifying the Problem and Opportunity

Helpful resource: the [Google Ventures Questions to Ask Before Starting User Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/questions-to-ask-before-starting-user-research) 

* What questions do you want to answer?
* What features/tasks do you want to test?
