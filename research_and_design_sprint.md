# Research and Design Sprint

## What is This All About?
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The point of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version. 

## People and Supplies
