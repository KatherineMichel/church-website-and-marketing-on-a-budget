# Research and Design Sprint

## Purpose
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version. 

## People and Supplies

## Identifying the Problem and Opportunity

Helpful resource: the [Google Ventures Questions to Ask Before Starting User Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/questions-to-ask-before-starting-user-research) 

### The "business" problem

* Dwindling local population 
* Predominantly middle age and older local population
* Four churches in close proximity
* Increasingly digital lifestyles

### The "business" opportunity
 
* Untapped potential via modernization
* More channels than ever to reach people
* Greater accessibility of resources and knowledge
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* Larger potential user base
 
### Leverage

* What questions do you want to answer?
* What features/tasks do you want to test?
