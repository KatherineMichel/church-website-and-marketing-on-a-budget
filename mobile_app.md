Marc Andreessen ([@pmarca](https://twitter.com/pmarca)) famously wrote that [Software is Eating the World](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html). 

Balaji Srinivasan ([@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis)) famously wrote that [Software is Reorganizing the World](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations). 

Fred Wilson ([@fredwilson](https://twitter.com/fredwilson)) famously wrote that [Mobile is Eating the World](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/mobile-is-eating-the-world.html). 

Though there is an "upper bound" to area population, as Balaji Srinivasan points out, "when cloud formations take physical shape, neither their scale nor duration has an upper bound."
