# New Marketing Materials

## New Website
The church website has a clean, modern, minimalistic look, with a lightweight, responsive layout that adapts well from desktop to mobile, and other devices. The website is reasonably priced and has an intuitive content management system that can be used by non-techies and occasional volunteers in order to keep the content relevant. 

Rather than one prominent homepage photo, the homepage features a patchwork quilt of photos that represent a number of people and activities in the church. Clicking on a photo brings up a small bite of info about the photo subject. This format is straight forward, easy to navigate, and highly mobile optimized.
