# New Marketing Materials

The number of church outreach materials has been streamlined, with a common brand experience incorporated into them all. For example, instead of twelve inconsistently designed post cards, one beautiful postcard template can be altered to suit the purpose at hand. 

Templates in both color and black-and-white are used to address the impracticality of printing color copies versus sending electronically.
