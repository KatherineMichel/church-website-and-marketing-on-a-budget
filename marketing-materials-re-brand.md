## Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity). Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. Like a congregation, a field sunflowers with their faces to the sun symbolizes warm welcome, bright optimism, and renewal.
