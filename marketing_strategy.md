### Outreach Calendar

The church purchased a 2015 wall calendar. The calendar would be hung on a hook on the wall in a high traffic area of the church where it would not be forgotten. A pencil would be nearby so that the calendar could be easily updated. The calendar could be removed from the wall and taken to meetings too.

### Marketing Plan

Members of the NOW (Nurture, Outreach, Witness) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church, would begin to collaborate on a new church Marketing Plan. 

### Contacting Inactive Members

### Telephone Book

Setting aside pre-existing assumptions, members of the church would go through the Pretty Prairie section of the phone book to identify people for outreach.
