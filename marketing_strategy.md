# Marketing Strategy

### Demographic Info

Through the national United Methodist Church, I obtained the most recent Nielson Company demographic info for the city of Pretty Prairie, Kansas.

### Outreach Calendar

The church purchased a 2015 wall calendar. The calendar would be hung on a hook on the wall in a high traffic area of the church where it would not be forgotten. A pencil would be nearby so that the calendar could be easily updated. The calendar could be removed from the wall and taken to meetings too.

### Marketing Plan

Members of the NOW (Nurture, Outreach, Witness) Committee, which handles community outreach for the church, would begin to collaborate on a new church Marketing Plan.

### Telephone Book

Setting aside pre-existing assumptions, members of the church would go through the Pretty Prairie section of the phone book to identify people for outreach.

### Skills Inventory

Members of the church would take stock of the skills of individual members. 

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 

Google is the most popular search engine in most countries. SEO is an important aspect of ensuring that people 'discover' your website

Also, consider creating a Google+ organization page, and/or Google rich snippet for support

### Church Mission Statement

It's a good time to consider the church's mission statement: 

### Church Communication Definition

Church Communication is church outreach to church members and other potentially interested parties

### Church Marketing Definition

Church Marketing is strategic planning for said outreach
