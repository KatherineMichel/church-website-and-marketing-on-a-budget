# New Marketing Strategy
The new marketing strategy incorporates both traditional and modern methods in order to fit with changing lifestyles, and reach the most people possible, perhaps even beyond city boundaries. The strategy is also as cost effective as possible. We would first begin to identify and take advantage of all "low-hanging fruit" previously overlooked. Beyond low-hanging fruit, we would consider the cost versus potential benefit. 

## Major, New Developments

### New Sanctuary Equipment
As the revitalization effort generated momentum, an anonymous donor made a generous donation to purchase new, large flat-screen televisions and a laptop for the church sanctuary, to be used to play contemporary videos and music, and to project the words of the hymns.

#### Worship Committee
It was decided during an Administrative Council Meeting that a new Worship Committee would be formed to oversee Worship Service Design. 

## Self-Sustaining Publicity Engine
We would aspire to create a self-sustaining publicity engine made up of church leaders, committee leaders and members, and congregation members (of all ages and backgrounds) working together in synergy. This would include: 

* Church Leaders
* Administrative Council
* Worship Committee
* NOW Committee (Nurture, Outreach, Witness)
* A new Youth Leadership Initiative

Example duties: brainstorming, helping to plan outreach activities, admin status for website/social media 

The church purchased a 2015 wall calendar. This Outreach Calendar Calendar is hung on a hook on the wall in a high traffic area of the church where it will not be overlooked. A pen and post it notes are nearby so that the calendar can be easily updated. The calendar can be removed from the wall and taken to meetings too. The calendar would help to keep everyone "on the same page."

### Youth Leadership Initiative
A Youth Leadership Initiative would be formed to assist with publicity duties such as running the new screen videos and music during worship, taking photos and/or writing blog posts.

After identifying relevant duties, I would develop a set of training materials for the Youth Leadership Initiative. I would go over these with the youth during Sunday School. 

## Example Marketing Plan

### Budget

### Low-Hanging Fruit"

#### Local Newspaper
The church could submit articles and general information to the local newspaper. Although individual church members were occasionally submitting articles, this was being done ad hoc, without a coordinated strategy.

Also, the church had not fully made use of its information space in the newspaper's Church Calendar section.

### Online Advertising

#### Facebook Advertising (Paid)

Based on feedback, members of the church and surrounding community are more likely to be on Facebook than Twitter. So, we would first consider the option of reaching people via Facebook, first through free sharing.

In addition to free sharing, Facebook also offers paid advertising to people located within a target area. 

One option would be to advertise the church's Facebook Page via the "Local Awareness" option to "reach people near your business."
