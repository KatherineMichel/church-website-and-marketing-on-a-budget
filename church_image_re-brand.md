# Church Image Re-Brand

Like the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church itself, the new church theme will beautifully blend the traditional and the contemporary by incorporating the traditional United Methodist Church [black cross and flame](http://cdnfiles.umc.org/Website_Properties/Resources/graphics-library/cross-and-flame-bw-1058x1818.png) with a contemporary sunflower motif.

## Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity). Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. The sunflower symbolizes warm welcome, bright optimism, and renewal.
