# Church Image Re-Brand

For the tl:dr go to [New Marketing Materials](new_marketing_materials.md) to see the new branding in use. 

Like the Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church itself, the new church theme will beautifully blend the traditional and the contemporary by incorporating the traditional United Methodist Church [black cross and flame](http://cdnfiles.umc.org/Website_Properties/Resources/graphics-library/cross-and-flame-bw-1058x1818.png) with a contemporary sunflower motif.

## Significance of the Sunflower

The Pretty Prairie United Methodist Church is in the state of Kansas (where the state flower is the sunflower), in a town called Pretty Prairie (where "pretty prairies" of sunflowers can be found in the vicinity). Yellow is a "warm" color, reminiscent of the sun. The sunflower symbolizes warm welcome, bright optimism, and renewal.
