### Church Governance Structure

### Constraints
The cost of the website and marketing materials would need to fit within the church's budget. Where possible, the project would use low cost tools and available resources:

* Existing staff, budget, and other resources 
* Time and skill of volunteers, donated money, goods and services
* Free resources and methods

### Budget

Free social media accounts
Free sharing
Free analytics
Low-cost Web Hosts
