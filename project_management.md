# Project Management

## Purpose
I conducted a Research and Design Sprint loosely based on the Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint) models. 

The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version. 

### Church Governance Structure

### Constraints
The cost of the website and marketing materials would need to fit within the church's budget. Where possible, the project would use low cost tools and available resources:

* Existing staff, budget, and other resources 
* Time and skill of volunteers, donated money, goods and services
* Free resources and methods

### Budget

Free social media accounts
Free sharing
Free analytics
Low-cost Web Hosts
Ads
