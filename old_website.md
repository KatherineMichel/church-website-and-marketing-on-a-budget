# Old Website

### Areas for Improvement
* The website was made using an outdated technique called Flash
* Poor color choice (blue and pink are not complementary)
* Use of clip art should be avoided if possible
* Welcome Page runs the risk of being a "data dump," wasted space
* Photo Page grid not aesthetically pleasing
* Wasted space in Youth Activities Page
* No social media sharing options
* Archaic design for website header/nav-bar
* Website does not seem representative of all church demographics, groups, activities
