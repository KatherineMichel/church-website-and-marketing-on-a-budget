# Changing Global Landscape

## Disruption
Remember the story of David and Goliath? Just like David killed Goliath by finding Goliath's achilles heel, as software eats the world, tech startups are finding the achilles heels of their less agile incumbent competitors. The business opportunities exploited by newcomers are often opportunities overlooked by incumbents due to: 

* Lack of knowledge/foresight
* Pre-existing assumptions

## Google Trends Graph for Phrases "United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App" "Upworthy"

Google Trends graph for phrases ["United Methodist Church" "LifeChurch" "The Bible App" "Upworthy" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=United%20Methodist%20Church%2C%20LifeChurch%2C%20The%20Bible%20App%2C%20Upworthy&cmpt=q&tz=), from 2004 to 2015. The United Methodist Church, which is clearly on the decline, is still a "giant" compared to Upworthy at Upworthy's peak search volume. LifeChurch and The Bible App are miniscule in comparison, but on the rise and with a strong, modern network effect in place of the sort that could disrupt traditional church.

## What the Church Can Learn from The Bible App and Upworthy 

### The Good News

The success of The Bible App and Upworthy shows that there can be a thriving market for religious and uplifting content. 

### The Bad News

It appears that in order to effectively compete, the United Methodist Church needs to repackage its message and how it is delivered. The longer the church takes to do this, the harder it may be due to [Network Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) and the [Law of Accelerating Returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change). 

### Competitor Idea Maze

The organizations that stay relevant, will not be the ones that are the most pious. They will be the ones that adapt the fastest, and the best, and achieve a network effect. 

The church should not exactly aspire to copy The Bible App or to be like Upworthy. The church should use case studies such as these to extract knowledge that can be applied to reach a similar popularity, but within the context appropriate to the United Methodist Church.

### Mobile Leap-Frogging Desktop in Developing Countries 

 In some developing countries, a mobile phone may be the first and only "computer" people can afford, which is perhaps why many of the countries recording the highest levels of Google Trends search interest for [The Bible App](the_bible_app_case_study.md) are African countries. 
 
## National Church Re-Imagined

Physical proximity limits outreach. Physical proximity is decreasing in importance. More people than ever can be reached all over the world via the internet in real time.  

### National Church Re-Imagined
* Put equal emphasis on physical, digital, and partnership
* Maintain a full-stack architecture anytime possible
* Publicize to existing membership to help achieve a network effect
* Optimize for psychology and sharing
* Practice minimalism as mush as possible, but design to reach people who are using different devices (example. more mobile use in the developing world)
* Integrate new methods of ministry. This also creates new publicity angles
