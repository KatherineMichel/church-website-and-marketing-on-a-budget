# Changing Global Landscape

"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." - Wayne Gretzky

## Digital and philosophical reorganization

Marc Andreessen ([@pmarca](https://twitter.com/pmarca)) famously wrote that [Software is Eating the World](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html). 

Balaji Srinivasan ([@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis)) famously wrote that [Software is Reorganizing the World](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations).

Though there is an "upper bound" to area population, as Balaji Srinivasan points out, "when cloud formations take physical shape, neither their scale nor duration has an upper bound."

## Competitor Idea Maze
Any entity vying for attention is a competitor. Any entity occupying high value real estate on a home screen, or search result is a competitor. Any entity achieving a viral campaign over yours is a competitor. 

## Google Trends Graph for Phrases "iPhone" "app" "Android" "desktop" "website"

Google Trends graph for phrases ["iPhone" "app" "Android" "desktop" "website" (region: worldwide)](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iPhone%2C%20app%2C%20Android%2C%20desktop%2C%20website&cmpt=q&tz=), from 2004 to 2015. Words associated with mobile ("iPhone" "app" "Android") are up and to the right. Non-mobile words ("desktop" "website") are on the decline.

## Device and Content

### Mobile Leap-Frogging Desktop in Developing Countries 

 In some developing countries, a mobile phone may be the first and only "computer" people can afford, which is perhaps why many of the countries recording the highest levels of Google Trends search interest for [The Bible App](the_bible_app_case_study.md) are African countries. 
 
## What the Church Can Learn from The Bible App and Upworthy 

As software and mobile "eat the world," and our lifestyles are reorganized, the winning organizations will not be the ones that are the most pious, but simply the ones that adapt the fastest and the best.

The success of The Bible App and Upworthy shows that there can be a thriving market for religious and uplifting content. It appears that in order to effectively compete, the United Methodist Church needs to repackage its message and how it is delivered. 

The church should not exactly aspire to copy The Bible App or to be like Upworthy. The church should use case studies such as these to extract knowledge that can be applied to reach a similar popularity, but within the context appropriate to the United Methodist Church. 

### "Business" Opportunities
On the bright side, there are some untapped opportunities:
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* More channels (traditional and digital) than ever to reach people and more people than ever to reach
* New and undiscovered ways to minister

## Possible Reasons for Missed Opportunities 
These opportunities could be easy to overlook though due to:
* Lack of knowledge/foresight
* Pre-existing assumptions

gauge the effectiveness of traditional and modern religious methods. Insight into tech trends and which channels could be the best to use to reach people locally, or perhaps even worldwide.
