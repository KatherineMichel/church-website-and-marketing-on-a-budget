## Changing Lifestyles

Marc Andreessen ([@pmarca](https://twitter.com/pmarca)) famously wrote that [Software is Eating the World](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html). 

Balaji Srinivasan ([@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis)) famously wrote that [Software is Reorganizing the World](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations). 

Fred Wilson ([@fredwilson](https://twitter.com/fredwilson)) famously wrote that [Mobile is Eating the World](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/06/mobile-is-eating-the-world.html). 

Though there is an "upper bound" to area population, as Balaji Srinivasan points out, "when cloud formations take physical shape, neither their scale nor duration has an upper bound." 

As software and mobile "eat the world," and our lifestyles are reorganized, the winning organizations will be the ones that adapt the fastest and the best.

## What the Church Can Learn from The Bible App and Upworthy 



The church should not exactly aspire to copy The Bible App or to be like Upworthy. However, their success shows that there is still a market for religious and "uplifting" content.

But with competitors such as these, the church may need to repackage its message and how the message is delivered if it is to realistically continue to compete for the public' attention.  
The success of Upworthy seems to make moot the argument that people are no longer interested in that which is uplifting. 

Possible reasons for missed opportunities
* Lack of knowledge/foresight
* Pre-existing assumptions








There are both challenges and untapped opportunities. 

gauge the effectiveness of traditional and modern religious methods. Insight into tech trends and which channels could be the best to use to reach people locally, or perhaps even worldwide.

Mobile leap-frogging desktop
 In some developing countries, a mobile phone may be the first and only "computer" people can afford, which is perhaps why many of the countries recording the highest levels of Google Trends search interest for [The Bible App](the_bible_app_case_study.md) are African countries. 

* Changing lifestyles (digital and philosophical reorganization)

### The "Business" Opportunity
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* More channels (traditional and digital) than ever to reach people and more people than ever to reach
* New and undiscovered ways to minister

Power Laws
* Moore's Law
* The Law of Accelerating Returns
* Network Effect
