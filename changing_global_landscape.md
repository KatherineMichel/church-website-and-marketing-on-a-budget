## What the Church Can Learn from The Bible App and Upworthy 

As software and mobile "eat the world," and our lifestyles are reorganized, the winning organizations will not be the ones that are the most pious, but simply the ones that adapt the fastest and the best.

The success of The Bible App and Upworthy shows that there can be a thriving market for religious and uplifting content. It appears that in order to effectively compete, the United Methodist Church needs to repackage its message and how it is delivered. 

The church should not exactly aspire to copy The Bible App or to be like Upworthy. The church should use case studies such as these to extract knowledge that can be applied to reach a similar popularity, but within the context appropriate to the United Methodist Church.

## Device and Content

### Mobile Leap-Frogging Desktop in Developing Countries 

 In some developing countries, a mobile phone may be the first and only "computer" people can afford, which is perhaps why many of the countries recording the highest levels of Google Trends search interest for [The Bible App](the_bible_app_case_study.md) are African countries. 
 
### "Business" Opportunities
On the bright side, there are some untapped opportunities:
* Decreasing importance of physical proximity
* More channels (traditional and digital) than ever to reach people and more people than ever to reach
* New and undiscovered ways to minister

* The opportunity is to reach people anywhere in the world using desktop and/or mobile
* Region/physical proximity- limit
* Digital- no limit

## Possible Reasons for Missed Opportunities 
These opportunities could be easy to overlook though due to:
* Lack of knowledge/foresight
* Pre-existing assumptions
